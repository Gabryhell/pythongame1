# Spooky Platforms
Hi, im a normal human being, 17 male, and I am interested in coding, especially Game Dev since I cant create Robots (financial issues).
This has been a fun journey in discovering python and pygame. I hope I'll benefit from learning this in the future
This was supposed to come out on Halloween but school didn't allow me to get in those hours.
This project took about 30-40 hours (like I said, it was my first time coding in python, especially pygame)
